# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I work as a Testing consultant and SDET. I am also an Improviser. My biggest assets are:<br>
<b>Team player</b>. I thrive in a team. Improvising trained me to carefully listen and understand how can I make the biggest impact. I follow the Essentialism motto; so I really value delegating and sharing responsibilities.<br>
<b>Heavy Lifter</b>. I understand that results take hard work, that is why I train every day. I like to be at the top of my craft and willing to go the extra mile.<br>
<b>Having fun</b>. I know that having fun as important as results, that is why you can't tell I train every day! My personal goal is to empower everyone in the and create the best environment, so we love coming to work!<br>
