This post is more personal than usual, and I hope you can relate to some parts. I decided to share my struggle finding direction and goals. Let's start with an introduction.

Hola. I am Gino. I am 27, originally from Spain but currently living in Copenhagen. I work on a not-so-demanding job that supports me and my partner in an extremely expensive city (my rent is higher than the base salary of my siblings). I have a nurturing group of friends and a supportive and attentive partner.

I workout five times a week, eat healthy enough and find joy in my hobbies. I am part of an amateur sports team, and I am performing improv on stage most weeks. I have even read more than two books a month for the last three years.

**And I feel completely and utterly lost in my life.**

## My career

I studied computer science and easily found my career path. A place where I could use both my passion for understanding problems and my skills in building software: Testing Automation was such an easy match.

Working in automation was a clear winner. I was able to move abroad, have a nice salary and fill a needed role; and it wasn't extremely demanding! I really value my spare time.

What I love about my job has been evolving during the last years. I **love pairing with people** and bringing pragmatic points of view early on the discussion. I enjoy **understanding entire systems** and **providing a bigger picture** while working on a problem. I also like **leading**, both managing and empowering my colleagues.

But there are many things that are not for me in my current position. Coding is less appealing to me by the day. I **miss **more **human interaction**. I would like more manual labour or work within a team more often. And I **wish I could give workshops** and teach more often.

But I am aware that **my career is bringing me down**. Each day I feel less motivated to step out of my home. I even find so many excuses to not spend time actually doing my job. I feel lost and stuck in this situation.

## My relationships

I am lucky to have such a supportive partner on my side and many inspiring friends.

Something that defines my relationship is **my fear of needing someone**. I don't feel comfortable when a connection is defined by necessity. I value when we spend time together because we want to, instead of needing it. I choose people because they make my life better.

**Being a caregiver** is also part of how I see myself. I love being useful while helping the people I care about, or by trying to make the world a better place. I can see the impact on helping some people around me. Those whom I know they are struggling. Those who just need a little push to take the reigns and change this world.

I stress too much about my relationships because I **take unnecessary responsibilities**, creating extra burdens. 

##  My place in the world

**I am not going to be the leader who will bring the revolution, and I am happy with it**. Not everyone will change this world. And, for every leader, there is a need for a second in command. I usually fill a supportive role. I am comfortable giving my time and resources. I like enabling the people I feel will change the world.

**I talk about things more than I do things**. In any hobby, I am more concerned with finding the most efficient way to perform something; than performing it. I am usually a better coach or trainer than a player.

All the previous identity statements create a **big internal conflict**. Nowadays, many people think we are all achievers and I should aim for that, but I am actually comfortable in a supporting position. Understanding that the traits I like about myself can't build on a career also affects me. WIll I only be successful if I partner with a doer?

## Things that I'm proud of

Being a natural giver, I **love the impact I have had on the people I care about**. Seeing how the spark of inspiration, or just that little push, has helped them grow into such beautiful beings.

Due to my love for theory-crafting, I **love endless discussions**. And that makes me an amazing muse. I don't know how to finish any project but I am amazing inspiring others and keeping them on track. I am also an excellent idea generator.

Pragmatism is something I easily bring to the table. I am quite good at offering realistic points of view. That has allowed me to **plan ahead for many challenges** which actually arose. I believe that if you fantasize about a situation, you will be better prepared for it.

##  Things that I certainly should change

**Not wanting to need anyone is hindering my enjoyment of life**. It blocks my ability for commitment. I can't really lose myself in the moment. I can't truly fight for something if I don't believe I actually require it.

**I generally take a supportive role because I see it as the only way to make an impact**. It probably comes from the notion of not really accomplishing anything by myself. I take the "parental" role, supporting and nurturing others, making them grow. 

**Pragmatism can also lead to being too negative**. Realising every way something might go wrong easily produces paralysis. What is the point of starting the problem with such a challenge? I should really be more mindful on the way I share this insight and find ways to express it in an encouraging way. "Let's be prepared for these challenges" instead of "just be aware of these problems".

**I need stability in many aspects of my life**, which heavily limits the kind of risks I am willing to take with my career and life. [Unf*ck Yourself](https://www.amazon.com/Unfu-Yourself-Your-Head-into/dp/0062803832) touches on the subject. If I want to grow and change my situation, my stability will be challenged; and I get really anxious by the thought of it.

## What am I doing to get there?

In my career, I am looking for **opportunities that are more social and less technical**. Taking more responsibilities regarding people management. 

Am I also looking for other incomes and toying with the idea of a **less stable and more fulfilling path**. There are so many skills I can learn about taking a different path.

In my life, I should **stop waiting for motivation**. The perfect situation is not going to come, and I will always be able to find a thousand reasons why things will crumble. But I am going to just chase opportunities. I will keep moving and inventing, and if something arises, it will be handled!

**I can't get enough of so many new activities**! I never thought of them before. Activities like **engaging with an audience**. Or **bringing playfulness to a team**, with games and fun competition. Or **keeping a group motivated and happy**, fostering a better team spirit. I wish my career involved more of these skills. 

I am also going to **take more risks**. I will assign a quota of resources I am willing to gamble with trying new things. Let's spend a little bit of time building a blog, even if it will never take off. Let's invest some money in building the prototype of an app, even if no one will use it. I have to **rethink commitment as giving my all for as long as it is relevant, not the need of sticking with something till the end of time**

## Conclusion

I** feel lost**. Society makes me feel that I shouldn't feel lost, but there is no denying how I feel. I didn't have any big trauma during my childhood. I had an amazing parental example. I have never had any big problem. But I still can't find myself, regardless of all the privileges I am enjoying.

I am ashamed of being lost, but that is nonsense. It is just part of my life. And, if you're lost, hopefully knowing that you are not alone helping.
