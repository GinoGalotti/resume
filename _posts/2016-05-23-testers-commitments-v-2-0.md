I've already talked about [James Bach's tester's commitments]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-03-22-hi-im-your-tester %}), but I have problems making that promise to my colleagues, as I don't share some parts of them so I want to create my own version. I want to include Quality Assistance values, as well as some experiences; and keep them as short, simple and relevant as possible. These are my commitments:

> I provide a service. You are an important client of that service. I am not satisfied unless you are satisfied.
> I am not the gatekeeper of quality. I don’t “own” quality. Shipping a good product is a goal shared by all of us.
> I will assist you in the design of the product to ensure its testability.
> I will support you in any task to deliver a better quality product.
> I will provide guidance in your testing efforts, sharing my knowledge with you and helping with any tool or technique needed.
> I will learn the product quickly, and make use of that knowledge to test more cleverly.
> I will help you identifying important things to test first and try to find important problems first.
> I will strive to test in the interests of everyone whose opinions matter, including you, so that you can make better decisions about the product.
> I will write clear, concise, thoughtful, and respectful problem reports. (I may make suggestions about design, but I will never presume to be the designer.)
> I invite your special requests, such as if you need me to spot check something for you, help you document something, or run a special kind of test.
> I will not carelessly waste your time. Or if I do, I will learn from that mistake.

I know that the list will evolve with time and experience, but these are the commitments I make today for you.
