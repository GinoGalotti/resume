Today I spent my retrospective break thinking what I value from a colleague and why. The reasons were simple: identifying what is important to me, especially now that I'm reading [Subliminal](http://www.amazon.com/Subliminal-Your-Unconscious-Rules-Behavior/dp/0307472256); and understanding what makes them amazing colleagues will help shape myself into one. This is obviously personal preferences, and as you imagine most of the points are not even technical. So let's start!

* Passionate about their craft. When you work with people that love what they do, they'll try to do it better. And, more importantly, passion is contagious!
* Critic, but not a Grinch. The main difference for me is proposing and trying different solutions instead of just complaining.
* Up for a conversation. I want to be surrounded but people social enough that doesn't cause awkward meetings.
* Skillful. Right now, learning is what drives me the most, and my colleagues are an invaluable learning resource!
* Resilient enough to take some jokes. Unfortunately, I love joking and making comes, and I'm more than pleased to take them back. For me, having the freedom of pulling our legs from time to time without dramas makes a huge difference in the team.
* Not a diva. This collides with previous points, but by experience: Discussing with divas about some work related subject is not productive at all.
* As different to me as possible. Because skill is not the only subject I have to learn.
* Autonomous without fear to delegate. This is really hard to find, but having a team that you know will get the task done, and that they count on you is the most productive environment.
* Healthier work/life balance than me. I know I'm lacking it, and if I surround myself with people like me it'll get worse.
* Open to socialise. I'm always the new one, and I love being abroad. Having colleagues open for a beer is needed sometimes.

Which are the virtues you value from your colleagues? I'm trying my best to improve all the points in this list. If I wouldn't enjoy working with myself, I can't expect anyone else to do so.
